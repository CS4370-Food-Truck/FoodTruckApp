**REQUIREMENTS**
  1. Ruby version 3.1.0
  2. Rails version 7.0.3.1
  3. A google API key
  4. 
If rails is already installed on your devise, using this should be as simple as cloning the repository, plugging in your API Key and running the server.

**Getting an API KEY**
A Google API key is an essential part. It is what will allow the host to use the google map feature. 
This is a link to the google map's platform where you can get an API key. 
https://mapsplatform.google.com/

Google provides access to free API keys. It does require you put in a card, but it won't charge you unless you surpass thier limit for free feature. For example, having more than 12 API keys.
